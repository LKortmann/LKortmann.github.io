Hi, I'm Lisa. I am working in social science research on age(ing) for about seven years and  I am currently employed at the [Institute for Ageing Research](https://www.ost.ch/de/forschung-und-dienstleistungen/interdisziplinaere-themen/iaf-institut-fuer-altersforschung) at the Eastern University of Applied Sciences in the Competence Centre Social Innovations and Age(ing). I am also doing my PhD at the [Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin](https://www.bgss.hu-berlin.de/en/people/docres/lisa-kortmann), where I recently submitted my thesis on digitalisation and older workers. 

# Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
